# PLDG Project Proposals & Contributor Workflow

This repository serves as the **entry point for PLDG cohort contributors** to propose, plan, and execute open-source projects aligned with Akave’s product direction and ICP.

The goal of this workflow is to ensure:
- Clear problem definition
- Thoughtful technical planning
- Efficient use of PLDG engineering support
- High-quality, maintainable contributions to the Akave ecosystem

---

## Contributor Workflow (High Level)

### Phase 1: Project Selection
Contributors start by selecting a project idea that aligns with:
- Akave’s ICP and roadmap
- The contributor’s skills and interests
- The scope of the PLDG cohort timeline

Projects may be undertaken:
- **Individually** (recommended for well-scoped work)
- **In groups** (recommended for larger or multi-component systems)

If you are looking for collaborators, use the **#akave channel on Discord** to describe your idea and request teammates.

---

### Phase 2: Project Proposal
Before any implementation begins, contributors must submit a **project proposal**.

Each project must include:
- A clearly defined problem statement
- Scope and non-goals
- Intended users / ICP alignment
- High-level technical approach
- Expected deliverables and success criteria

📄 File:  
`<project-name>/PROPOSAL.md`

Submit the proposal via a pull request to this repository.

Proposals are reviewed by the Akave team to ensure feasibility and alignment. Review timelines can vary based on volume.

---

### Phase 3: Execution & Issue Tracking
After proposal approval, contributors should create a plan:

📄 File:  
`<project-name>/PLAN.md`

After plan approval:
- A **main tracking issue** is created in the implementation repository
- Sub-issues are created for each milestone defined in the plan
- Progress is tracked through issues and pull requests

This ensures transparency, reviewability, and alignment throughout execution.

---

## Review & Iteration
Projects are expected to evolve during execution. Iteration is encouraged, but:
- Major scope or architecture changes should be discussed early
- Updates should be reflected in issues or documentation as needed

---

## What This Repo Is (and Is Not)

**This repo is:**
- A coordination and planning layer
- A place for proposals and approved plans
- A shared reference for contributors and reviewers

**This repo is not:**
- The implementation repository
- A dumping ground for unfinished ideas
- A substitute for proper planning and review
