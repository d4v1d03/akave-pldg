# AkaveLog: Decentralized Log Ingestion, Storage, and Visualization using Akave O3


## Problem Statement
Modern log management systems such as Graylog and ELK rely on centralized storage and compute-heavy infrastructure. As log volumes grow, teams face increasing costs, operational complexity, and vendor lock-in. These systems also provide limited transparency into how log data is stored and retained.

There is a clear need for a cost-efficient, scalable, and transparent log storage solution that decouples log ingestion and visualization from centralized storage.

## Objective
Build a Graylog-inspired, full-stack logging platform where log data is:
- Ingested via a lightweight service
- Persisted immutably in **Akave O3**
- Indexed for efficient querying
- Visualized through a web-based UI with filtering and alerting

This project validates **Akave O3** as a durable, decentralized backend for large-scale log storage.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Log ingestion service (HTTP / agent-based)
- Uploading and storing log objects in Akave O3
- Metadata indexing (timestamp, service name, log level, tags)
- Web UI for:
  - Time-range queries
  - Full-text and field-based filtering
  - Basic alert rules (keyword / threshold-based)
- End-to-end working demo with real log streams

### Out of Scope
- Full feature parity with Graylog
- Advanced RBAC or enterprise authentication
- Hard real-time log streaming guarantees

## Intended Users / ICP
- Infrastructure and DevOps teams
- Blockchain node operators
- Open-source projects with high log volume
- Cost-sensitive startups and protocols

## High-Level Architecture

### Log Ingestion Service (Go)
- Accepts logs via HTTP or lightweight agents
- Performs batching and compression
- Uploads log batches to Akave O3
- Returns object references for indexing

### Storage Layer (Akave O3)
- Stores raw logs as immutable objects
- Enables low-cost, scalable log retention
- Decouples storage from compute and querying

### Indexing Layer
- Stores log metadata in a lightweight database (PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Maps searchable fields to O3 object keys
- Enables fast discovery without duplicating data

### Frontend (Web UI)
- Graylog-inspired log explorer UI
- Filters by:
  - Time range
  - Service / source
  - Log level
  - Keywords
- Alert configuration UI for basic rules

## Expected Deliverables
- Log ingestion backend service
- O3-backed log storage pipeline
- Searchable and filterable log UI
- Alerting prototype
- Deployment and usage documentation
- Demo showcasing log ingestion → O3 storage → UI visualization

## Success Criteria
- Logs are reliably ingested and stored in Akave O3
- Users can query and view logs via the UI with filters
- Demonstrated scalability and cost benefits over centralized storage
- Clear documentation enabling others to extend or deploy the system

## Validation Goals
- Validate Akave O3 as a backend for log-heavy workloads
- Demonstrate practical integration with the Akave O3
- Showcase a real-world, infra-focused use case aligned with Akave’s ICP
